# DMIS at BioCreative VII NLMChem Track

This repository is for implementations of our systems submitted to the BC7 Challenge in 2021.

## Overview & Quick Links

* **Task description**: Full-text Chemical Identification and Indexing in PubMed articles. For detailed information, please visit to the official BC7 website ([link](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-2/)).
* **System description**: Please check out our papers listed below.
  * **[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10584)**(4 papes) provides a brief description of our system and some ablation results.
  * **[This paper](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baac074/6726385)**(8 pages) is an extension of the short system description paper above and is published on ***DATABASE*** in 2022. This paper details the motivation for selecting each system component and method. In addition, the limitations of the current system are discussed through error analysis of the model.

## Requirements

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Named Entity Normalization (NEN)
We will update it soon.
